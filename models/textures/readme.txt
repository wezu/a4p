texture naming convention:
Texture name should match model name unless the texture is used by many meshes
_n suffix is for ' rgb normal map'
_ns suffix is for 'rgb normal + alpha shine (gloss)'
_c suffix is for 'rgb color (diffuse)'
_cg suffix is for 'rgb color + 1-alpha glow' (alpha = black = no glow, alpha = white = full glow)
_ca suffix is for 'rgb color + alpha transparency'
no suffix should be  the same as '_ca'
